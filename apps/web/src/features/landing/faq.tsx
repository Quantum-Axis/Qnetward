const items = [
  {
    q: "Do I need to install anything to start?",
    a: "No. Sign up and run ICMP ping, TCP ping, port scans, and DNS lookups straight from the console. Agents for probing inside private networks are coming next.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I scan any host or domain?",
    a: "Diagnostics like ping and DNS work on any public target. Deeper security scanning will only run on assets you have verified you own, with rate limits and a full audit trail.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can my whole team use one account?",
    a: "Yes. Create a workspace, invite teammates by email, and give each person a role: owner, admin, or member. You can belong to several workspaces and switch between them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Where is my data stored?",
    a: "Results live in PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB in our primary region, Singapore. Per-region data residency is on the roadmap before we onboard customers who need it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I self-host Qnetward?",
    a: "The stack ships as Docker Compose today (API, dashboard, TimescaleDB, Redis, S3-compatible storage). A supported self-hosted edition is planned for enterprise teams.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get alerted?",
    a: "Set latency and packet-loss thresholds per target and get an email when a rule fires. Slack, Telegram, Discord, and webhooks are next.",
