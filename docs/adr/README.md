# Architecture Decision Records

This directory records decisions that are expensive to reverse, cut across
packages, or need their reasoning kept alongside the code.

Each record is one numbered Markdown file with four parts: status, context,
decision, consequences. To change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes
the old one and update the old one's status. Don't rewrite history in place.

Not every change needs an ADR. Bug fixes and endpoints that follow existing
patterns don't.
